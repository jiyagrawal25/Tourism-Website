    <p>Galtaji, located on the outskirts of Jaipur, Rajasthan, is an ancient Hindu pilgrimage site that is renowned for its temples, holy water tanks, and scenic beauty. The temple complex, also known as the Galta Temple, is situated amidst the Aravalli hills and features a series of sacred kunds (water tanks) where devotees come to bathe and seek blessings. The main temple, dedicated to **Sun God** Surya, is built in a traditional Rajput style and adorned with stunning frescoes and carvings. Galtaji is often referred to as the "Monkey Temple" because of the large population of monkeys that inhabit the area, creating a unique atmosphere. The site also offers panoramic views of Jaipur, making it a peaceful place for reflection and spiritual solace. The holy tanks, including the Galta Kund, are believed to have healing powers, and the temple complex is a blend of natural beauty and architectural splendor, making it a popular destination for both pilgrims and tourists.
