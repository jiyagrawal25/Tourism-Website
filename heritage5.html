        Hawa Mahal, also known as the "Palace of Winds," is one of Jaipur’s most iconic landmarks, renowned for its unique honeycomb-like façade with 953 intricately carved jharokhas (small windows). Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the five-story red and pink sandstone structure was designed by architect Lal Chand Ustad in the form of Lord Krishna’s crown. The palace was constructed to allow royal women to observe street festivities and daily life while remaining unseen, in accordance with the purdah system. The clever design ensures natural ventilation, keeping the interiors cool even during Rajasthan’s scorching summers. Hawa Mahal stands as a fine example of Rajput and Mughal architectural fusion, featuring delicate latticework, arched windows, and domed canopies. Today, it is a major tourist attraction, offering breathtaking views of Jaipur’s bustling streets and historical sites from its topmost floors.</p>
