        Amer Fort, also known as Amber Fort, is a majestic fortress located on a hilltop overlooking Maota Lake in Jaipur, Rajasthan. Built in 1592 by Raja Man Singh I, one of Emperor Akbarâ€™s trusted generals, the fort is an architectural masterpiece that blends Rajput and Mughal styles. Made of red sandstone and white marble, Amer Fort features grand palaces, intricately carved temples, sprawling courtyards, and stunning mirror work. The Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace), with its dazzling reflection effect, is one of its most famous attractions. The fort also houses the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), and Ganesh Pol, a beautifully decorated gateway. Once the royal residence of the Rajput rulers, Amer Fort is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a major tourist attraction, drawing visitors for its historical significance, breathtaking architecture, and mesmerizing light and sound show that narrates its rich history.
